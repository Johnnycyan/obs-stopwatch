# Usage
1. [Download the files](https://github.com/Johnnycyan/obs-stopwatch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Put them in a folder that you won't delete
3. Add the index.html as a browser source in OBS
4. Set the resolution of the browser source to 1200x800
5. Crop the bottom of the source to just the point where the buttons don't appear (this will ensure vertical centering stays intact)
6. To change the settings click on the source and click the Interact button (Settings will be disabled until timer is paused)
7. Settings are automatically and immediately applied
8. When you change the font the vertical crop will probably change so make sure to update it
9. You can resize the source afterwards to make it the size you want but don't change it in the properties
10. When resizing sources in OBS it is best to right-click them and set Scale Filtering to Area
